# poi数据集--
## Gowalla 数据集

Gowalla is a location-based social networking website where users share their locations by checking-in. The friendship network is undirected and was collected using their public API, and consists of 196,591 nodes and 950,327 edges. We have collected a total of 6,442,890 check-ins of these users over the period of Feb. 2009 - Oct. 2010.

## Brightkite 数据集
Brightkite was once a location-based social networking service provider where users shared their locations by checking-in. The friendship network was collected using their public API, and consists of 58,228 nodes and 214,078 edges. The network is originally directed but we have constructed a network with undirected edges when there is a friendship in both ways. We have also collected a total of 4,491,143 checkins of these users over the period of Apr. 2008 - Oct. 2010.
